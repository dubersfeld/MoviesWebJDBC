This is a demonstration project on Spring Boot development. It requires:

A recent MySQL server version installed (I used 8.0.6). 

A recent Maven version installed (I used 3.6.0).

In addition STS was used for development but is not required for running this application.

moviesDBBasic.sql was used to create and populate the MySQL database used in this project.

This project requires Java 8 Runtime Environment.

To launch the application run the command:

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

When the application has started hit the browser on localhost:8080/movies-web
