This is a demonstration project on Spring development. It involves:

MySQL as a database with Spring JDBC support
Eclipse Mars with Maven plugin
Tomcat 8 as a container

moviesDBBasic.sql was used to generate the MySql database used in this project.

This project can run on Tomcat 8 from Eclipse or on Tomcat 8 standalone from a .war file. It requires Java 8 Runtime Environment.

This is the first version of this project. More stuff is coming soon with a version that uses Hibernate with Spring support.

As a reference book I mainly used Java for Web Applications by Nicholas S. Williams
